     * @brief The Gelman-Rubin stopping rule for convergence between multiple runs.
     *
     * This stopping rule returns true when the the variance of samples between runs
     * is approximately as large as the variance within runs has been reached.
     * This rule is most useful if you want to check for convergence of continuous parameter
     * between runs.
