     * The narrow-exchange operator.

     * A NNI (nearest neighbour interchange) proposal on rooted trees WITH changing the node age.
     * That is, we pick a random node which is not the root and neither its parent is the root.
     * Then, we try to exchange the picked node with it's uncle. This move will automatically fail if the uncle is older than the parent.
