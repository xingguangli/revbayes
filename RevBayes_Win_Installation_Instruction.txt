RevBayes compilation under Windows

I. First you need to get some necessary software:
(1) Download and install cygwin. Make sure that you include gcc!!!
(2) Add the path to cygwin64\bin to the 'path' variable. This needs to be before the other windows variables!!!
((3) Download and install cmake.)
((4) Download and install git.)


II. Second, retrieve the RevBayes sources.
(1) Clone the git repository:
git clone https://github.com/revbayes/revbayes.git revbayes-master

III. Compile RevBayes.
(1) Open a terminal window and go to the RevBayes source directory if you haven't already done so, e.g., 
cd revbayes-master
(2) Next, go into the projects and then the cmake subdirectory: 
cd projects/cmake
(3) Now you can either build the standard version
bash build.sh -win TRUE
