<p>RevBayes was developed as a command-line_driven program. The user enters text at the user prompt, such as</p>

<p>x &lt;- readCharacterData(&ldquo;/Users/Sally/Desktop/mydata.nex&rdquo;)</p>

<p>to carry out tasks in the program. [This command would read in a nexus formatted data file (Maddison et al., 1997) and put it in a variable named &lsquo;x&rsquo; which would find a home in the &lsquo;workspace&rsquo; of the program.] Indeed, for most computer operating systems, only the command-line version of RevBayes is available. The graphical user interface (GUI) version of the program was developed as a fun experiment: Could an intuitive and engaging interface be developed for a phylogeny program? This is not an easy task. Estimating phylogeny is a daunting statistical problem requiring a model that incorporates stochastic processes and complicated algorithms to calculate probabilities (either exactly or approximately). How can instantiating such a complicated model be made fun or, excepting that goal, at least made intuitive?</p>

<p>The usual way in which a GUI is made for the phylogeny problem is to expose options in the relevant window. For example, different options for the stochastic model that describes how characters change along the branches of the phylogenetic tree might be exposed on a single window. The various model options would then be selected using check boxes or text fields. Several very good GUI programs have been developed for the phylogeny problem that use this idea, such as PAUP* (Swofford, 2003) and Mesquite (Maddison and Maddison, 2016). The problem with this approach is that as the models become more complicated, and require more &lsquo;switches&rsquo; to active the options, the interface becomes more complicated and cluttered. This approach is challenging to the developer, too, because each new model that is implemented for the user means that new real estate must be found on a window to place the switches that activate the model. To many users, their first experience using a phylogeny program is about as simple as working with a lunar command module panel,</p>

<p>Fortunately, the consequence of throwing a wrong switch for a program such as PAUP* is not as life threatening as throwing the wrong switch in a lunar command module! The goal in writing the GUI for RevBayes was to avoid an interface that was as cluttered as for a lunar command module, while still allowing for a plethora of models to be selected.</p>

<p>Another limitation of current phylogeny programs is the fact that it is difficult to replicate a phylogenetic analysis at some later date. How many times have you tried to reconstruct what you did in a phylogenetic analysis that was performed as recently as a month ago? Programs such as MrBayes or Beast (Drummond et al, 2012) produce many output files. Even remembering which data input file went with the output files can be daunting. Reconstructing the various settings and assumptions that went into the analysis can be still more challenging. In this program, we attempt to solve the analysis replication problem by maintaining an entire analysis as a logical whole. The entire analysis &ndash; data, modifications of data, model settings, algorithm settings, and output &ndash; are all saved together in one file which can be revived at any point in the future. We even allow you to save notes and images about the analysis in a virtual laboratory notebook.</p>

<p>RevBayes makes use of the metaphores of tools (to carry out specific tasks in a phylogenetic analysis) and of a graphical model (to describe the probability model used in the phylogenetic analysis; HÃ¶hna et al., 2014). In this help book, we describe the various tools that we implemented to expose the functionality of RevBayes. The most complicated tool is probably the Model Tool which allows the user to implement the modeling assumptions used in the phylogenetic analysis graphically.</p>
