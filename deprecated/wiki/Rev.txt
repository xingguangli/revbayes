This document describes the RevLanguage and should be seen as a reference rather than a manual. 

## Variables

The type of a variable in the RevLanguage is automatically determined. Therefore, the RevLanguage is a loosely typed language. A variable is created by the simple construct 
    
      variable_name <assignment_operator> expression
    

such as 
    
      a <var_name> in <container> <statement(s)>
    

A simple example of a loops is 
    
      sum
