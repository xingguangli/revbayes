To compile the RevBayes core using cmake, follow these instructions: 

  1. Download the source code from GitHub:  
     `git clone git@github.com:revbayes/revbayes.git revbayes`  
  2. Change directories:  
     `cd revbayes/projects/cmake`  
  3. Follow the instructions in the `README.txt` file [(link)](https://github.com/revbayes/revbayes/tree/master/projects/cmake). 

If you later commit changes to the RevBayes repository on GitHub, make sure you do not commit any of the files generated by the cmake compilation process in the 'revbayes/projects/cmake' directory. A good way to ensure that such files and directories do not get committed by mistake is to create a copy of the 'cmake' directory outside of your local git copy of the revbayes code repository, so that all files produced by the compilation end up outside of the local git directory.
