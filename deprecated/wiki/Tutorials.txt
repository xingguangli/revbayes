Several tutorials have been written for RevBayes. Each one explicitly walks you through model specification and analysis set-up for different phylogenetic methods. Including:
* Introduction to RevBayes and the Rev Language
* Basic Phylogenetic Models and MCMC
* Model Testing and Partitioning
* Estimating Speciation and Extinction
* Time-Tree Estimation
* MCMC and Output Analysis
* Gene-Tree/Species-Tree Inference
* Biogeography (Large State-Space Models)
* Analysis of Continuous-Trait Evolution

Currently, these tutorials are curated on our [workshop website](https://www.nescent.org/sites/academy/RevBayes_Workshop_Schedule). But will soon be available on our main page. (Check back for updates.)
