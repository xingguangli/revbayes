Plates, mixtures and trees are motifs of a DAG. For convenience (for moves notably), they have been individualized in revBayes, so that one can create a plate, a mixture or a tree as part of a DAG. Here we present what plates and mixtures are. 

  


## Plates

Plates are replicating units for independent identically distributed (iid) variables. When a part of a DAG corresponds to the exact repetition _N_ times of a particular motif, one can represent this entire set of motifs as a plate, indexed from 1 to _N_ (Fig. 1). The use of plates simplifies the representation of complex DAGs.

Fig. 1 reads as follows: we generate _N_ variables _Xi_ that are deterministic functions of variables _ri_, which are independent and identically distributed according to a distribution taking a single parameter _alpha_ as input. 

In the rev language, one can use a plate much like one would use a for loop, to replicate the dependencies between vectors of DAG nodes.

Example: a model of rate heterogeneity across sites can be seen as a plate, iterating over sites (Fig. 2). Indeed, for all sites the rate is independent and identically distributed, most often drawn from a discretized Gamma distribution. The discretized Gamma distribution itself can be seen as a plate, where e.g. 4 rates are draw from a Gamma distribution. 

## Mixtures

Mixtures can be seen as an elaboration upon a plate. Mixtures also provide ways to replicate iid variables. However their specificity comes from the fact that the iid variables depend upon a discrete distribution of parameters. Fig. 3 shows a discretized Gamma distribution represented as a mixture, and thus can be directly compared to Fig. 2. Contrary to Fig. 2, we have represented the set of available rates not as a plate but as a vector. Each site in an alignment has a rate drawn from the discretized Gamma distribution. Although both plates and mixtures can be used to represent the discretized Gamma distribution on site rates, the mixture representation is more flexible. 

Fig. 3 reads as follows: _N_ _Xi_ variables are deterministic functions of variables _ri_, which are iid according to a discrete distribution with _k_ categories taking a single parameter _alpha_ as input. There is an allocation vector _Ai_ that gives the index of the category for each _ri_: each _ri_ is just one of the _k_ values drawn from the discrete distribution.
