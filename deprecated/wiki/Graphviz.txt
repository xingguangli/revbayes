In RevBayes you can generate a file in the [DOT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) graph-description language. This file can then be opened and viewed in the program [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/) or in an [online GraphViz viewer](http://www.webgraphviz.com/).

##Example

Let's create a model where our observed value is drawn from a gamma distribution, where the hyper parameters of the gamma distribution are each given exponential hyperpriors. In the Rev language we would specify our model:
```
> alpha ~ dnExponential(1)
> beta ~ dnExponential(0.5)
> x ~ dnGamma(alpha, beta)
```

If we had an observed value for x, then we can clamp the data:
```
> x.clamp(8.0)
```

Then we can create our workspace model wrapper:
```
> mymodel = model(x)
```

The model object has a member method called ``.graph()`` which takes a file name string:
```
> mymodel.graph("gamma_model.dot")
```

If you have downloaded [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/), then open the file ``gamma_model.dot`` with that program. It should look like this:
[[img/gamma_model.png]]


Open the file ``gamma_model.dot`` in your text editor. If you do not have GraphViz installed, copy the contents of this file into an online viewer like [[http://www.webgraphviz.com/]].
