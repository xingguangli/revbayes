Proposal for future commit practices: 

1\. Coding style recommendations should be followed as closely as possible. 

2\. Comments need to be done properly using Doxygen style comments. No new code without proper comments, no copying and pasting from existing comments without proper editing. 

3\. Any deletion or renaming of functions or classes should be preceded by a discussion in the team unless it is trivial. The same goes for any major restructuring or refactoring of the code. Importantly, any renaming needs to be done consistently for the entire project. 

4\. Before committing new code, it is upon the person committing the code to make sure that the code compiles and runs the test.txt file in the test directory. 

5\. If a new feature is added, it should be tested and found to work before the new code is committed. It is recommended to add a minimum number of statements to the test.txt file to test the new feature, with an appropriate comment.
