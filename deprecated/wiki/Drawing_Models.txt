There are several options for visualizing a probabilistic graphical model. 
The figure-quality graphical models used in the tutorials, presentations, and papers associated with RevBayes
were created using the LaTeX package [tikz](http://www.texample.net/tikz/). Alternatively, if you specify a model in the Rev language, you can generate a file that can be opened in the program [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/). These two options are described in detail:
