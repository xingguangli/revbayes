This tutorial walks you through: 

  * How to set up a model 
  * How to attach data to the model 
  * How to run MCMC on the model 

The simple example that we use here are some observations from a normal distribution. We are interested in estimating the posterior probabilities of the mean and the variance parameters for the normal distribution.
