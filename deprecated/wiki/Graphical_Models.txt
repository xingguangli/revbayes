## Examples of Graphical models

### The GTR Model

[[img/Graph_mod.jpg]]

This model is derived from the GTR implementation in the file: TestGtrModel.cpp. In this example, the model specified includes a birth-death process on a rooted time-tree. Additionally, there are Dirichlet priors on the base frequencies and exchangeability rates. The tree height (or age of the root) is a DeterministicNode, thus we can create a monitor for that statistic.
